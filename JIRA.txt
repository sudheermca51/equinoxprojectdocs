
**What is Jira?**
**Jira** is a project management tool made by Atlassian. It’s mainly used for **tracking issues, bugs, and tasks**, especially in software development. Think of it like a supercharged to-do list that helps teams stay organized.

**Core Concepts**

- **Projects**: The container for all your work. Each team or product can have its own project.
- **Issues**: Everything in Jira is an *issue*. A task, a bug, a feature request—these are all called issues.
- **Workflows**: The steps an issue goes through, like: *To Do → In Progress → Done*.
- **Boards**: Visual displays (Kanban or Scrum-style) that show issues and their statuses.
- **Sprints** (in Scrum): Time-boxed periods (usually 1-2 weeks) where a set of issues are worked on.
- **Epics & Stories**:
  - **Epic**: A big chunk of work.
  - **Story**: A smaller task that’s part of an epic.

 **How Teams Use Jira**

- **Agile development**: Perfect for Scrum or Kanban teams.
- **Bug tracking**: Log, assign, and fix bugs.
- **Project tracking**: Set deadlines, assign owners, and monitor progress.

 **Typical Workflow**
1. Create a **project**.
2. Add **issues** (like tasks or bugs).
3. Prioritize and assign them.
4. Track progress on a **board**.
5. Move them through the workflow until done.

Quick Tips
- Use **filters** to find what you need fast.
- Use **labels** and **components** to organize issues.
- **Dashboards** let you see stats, charts, and progress at a glance.
- Keyboard shortcuts make things faster!

1. **Create a Test Case**
   - Go to the **Tests** section.
   - Create and define a **Test Case** with steps, expected results, etc.

2. **Create a Test Plan** *(Optional but useful for grouping tests for a release or objective)*
   - Helps organize multiple test cycles under one goal.
   - Add the relevant **Test Cases** to the Test Plan.

3. **Create a Test Cycle**
   - Test Cycles are where execution happens.
   - Inside a Test Plan (or stand-alone), create a **Test Cycle** (e.g., for a sprint, release, etc.).

4. **Add Test Cases to the Test Cycle**
   - Select and add test cases from your repository to the Test Cycle.

5. **Execute the Test Cases**
   - Go into the Test Cycle.
   - For each test case, update the execution status: **Pass**, **Fail**, **Blocked**, etc.
   - Optionally, attach evidence, raise bugs, add comments.
